    This is a Haskell function that implements a recursive algorithm. 
    It takes as input a list xs and a value w, and returns a pair of values.

    The function uses a case expression to match the input list xs. 
    If xs is empty, the function returns a pair (w, []). 
    Otherwise, it decomposes the input list xs into a head y and a tail ys, 
    and then it recursively calls the function foo on the tail ys and the value w.

    The result of the recursive call is a pair (c, cs), 
    which is then used to compute the final output of the function. 
    If y is greater than zero, the function returns a pair (1 + c, y:cs), 
    where y:cs is a new list formed by prepending y to the list cs. 
    Otherwise, if y is not greater than zero, the function returns the pair (c, cs) unchanged
    
    This function implements a filtering operation that removes all the negative elements from the input list xs, 
    and returns a pair of values: the first component is the count of positive elements in the filtered list, 
    and the second component is the filtered list itself.

{-
This is a Haskell function that generates a list using a recursive algorithm. 
It takes as input a function f and a value n, and returns a list of values.

The function uses an if-then-else expression to check if n is equal to zero. 
  If n is zero, the function returns an empty list []. 
  Otherwise, it computes the value f n, and then prepends it to the result of a recursive call to the function foo1 with the input f and n - 1.

The function implements a simple way of generating a list of values by repeatedly applying the function f to successive decrements of the input value n. 
The list generated by the function starts with f n, and continues with f (n - 1), f (n - 2), and so on, until n reaches zero, at which point the function returns an empty list.

{-
This is a Haskell function that calculates the value of the so-called "adult/baby" function for a given input n. 
The function f takes as input a value n and returns the result of evaluating the "adult/baby" function for n.

The "adult/baby" function is defined using two local definitions: baby and adult. 
Both baby and adult are recursive functions that take as input a value n and return a value.

The baby function checks if n is equal to zero. 
  If n is zero, the function returns zero. Otherwise, it returns the result of evaluating the adult function with the input n - 1.

The adult function checks if n is equal to zero. 
  If n is zero, the function returns one. Otherwise, it returns the sum of the results of evaluating the baby function with the input n - 1 and the adult function with the input n - 1.

Finally, the function f returns the result of evaluating the adult function with the input n.

This function implements a recursive definition of the "adult/baby" function, which has a combinatorial interpretation. 
The value of the function at a given input n can be thought of as counting the number of different ways of partitioning a group of n adults and babies into pairs, where each pair consists of one adult and one baby.

{-
The code that generates an infinite list of non-negative even numbers starting from 0
The list lst is defined as an infinite list that starts with 0, followed by a list comprehension that generates the next elements in the list. 
The list comprehension generates the next even number by multiplying the previous element in the list by 2.
This pattern will continue indefinitely, generating an infinite list of non-negative even numbers starting from 0.
